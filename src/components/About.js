<br/> We embarked on this journey in the year 2020. Engineers, Language Enthusiasts, Artists and Scientists were united in purpose, and came up with Grammar. It was hard, it was messy, but it was real and it made a difference in our lives,we sure hope that it will make a difference in yours! 
We would have shown our faces, however, we are quite shy, so Darling, you will have to bear with us until we gain the courage to show our Oh so amazing faces.</p>
